# Lel Nekoweb site

Just my personal site hosted on nekoweb, made in pure html, css and javascript.

## Templating

Wanna use my site as a template? Sure, just remove all the content and write your own, a lot of the pages have different themes so you can pick whichever one or even just parts of them, just credit me if you do :3 or else ill find you.

Unfortunately i dont plan on making any actual themes, not that there any good in the first place, but i do plan on migrating to Astro, and then you could use those Astro Layouts.
