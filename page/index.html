      <p style="animation: fadeIn 2s">
        Im <bold>lel</bold>, im not much of a talker so I dont know why I
        decided to make this page, afterall to make it look good I need to yap
        alot to fill up all this space, and even then nobodys going to read it
        except me, which is kind of annyoing considering I have to cringe at
        myself writing all of this for nothing, but then again im gonna send
        this in
        <i>every</i>
        discord channel i have so thats probably a few more views.
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fadeIn 3s">
        I dont really know what to say, so Ill say I little about myself. This
        is my first website but Ive always been into tech, since i was a kid
        with no internet untill now. Currently im just a student
        <sub>(and procrastinating by making this webpage)</sub> in computer
        science actually, however I actually do not go to school and study at
        home, thats why I never get shit done.
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fadeIn 4s">
        Other than tech, im a big fan of anime, or atleast i was a couple years
        ago, I started watching anime back in 2018,<small>
          now 6 years ago!! </small
        >and that was probably the first time I consumed non kid tv media. I
        enjoyed it enough to watch around 200 anime in just 2 years, but Id
        slowed down after that to only a few dozen anime a year (I know, very
        few /s). Even so I really like anime and even manga and VNs/LNs (even
        though i dont read books often), my favorite anime series and movies are
        often those with cross media story telling in their works, for example
        Fate with its many many spinoffs, all with connected concepts even with
        their creator, type-moon/kinoku nasu's other works. Theres also Toaru
        with <i>its</i> spinoffs and multiple perspectives.
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fadeIn 5s">
        anyways seems like ive padded up the text enough for now, I got the idea
        for this from
        <a href="https://remblanc.nekoweb.org">remblanc's website</a>, i liked
        how clean it looked but I also kind of wanted to have my own twist. So I
        choose monospace fonts because I like how they look, and instead of
        white on black I went with the
        <a href="https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest"
          >Everforest Dark theme</a
        >
        becuase I feel its a nice theme for showing alot of text, it was made
        for vim afterall.
