        Why do I need it pass a test for calculus level maths? like I
        <i>could</i> find it useful IRL <i>maybe</i> but honestly Im only gonna
        use it to pass this test. I need to be good at math to be in computer
        science? Sure in that case <em>ILL LEARN WHAT I NEED</em> you know
        <em>LIKE I DO WITH EVERYTHING ELSE</em>, forcing me learn shit I cant
        even with Motherfucking youtube Indian teach classes is just gonna make
        me bomb everything else Im actually good at.<sub>(not much)</sub>
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fade-in 3s">
        I also just don't like maths teachers much, I understand you cant bump
        up marks on something like maths because it isn't something subjective
        as English or something but still you could maybe
        <em>NOT DEDUCT MARKS FOR WRITING HALF INSTEAD OF HALVE,</em> if this
        isn't an english test don't grade me on my english, like dude that
        dropped me to 99/100 in like 2nd grade, the only grade a had a chance of
        acing a subject and I was denied that by some butthurt teacher who hates
        10 year olds or how ever old I was.
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fade-in 4s">
        back to AS Level maths it's funny I cant even use AI to learn it
        properly cuz AI's are apparently <em>FUCKING DOGSHIT</em> at maths, who
        would've thought that. Often time they just spew random shit that
        dose'nt make sense and just confuse me more, or assume I already know
        how to solve the question and Im testing it, dawg,

          JOB.</strong

      <p style="animation: fade-in 5s">
        This all isn't helped by the fact that the world decided education needs
        to be privilege of the rich, the mfs who already have everything,
        because I cant access some regular ass fucking questions or notes
        without paying like
        <a href="https://www.savemyexams.com/join/">20 bucks a month</a>. Wanna
        pirate it instead? well <em>FUCK YOU WE DMCAed THAT SHIT,</em> they took
        down fucking Past paper questions and answers and notes and shit
        <em>THAT THEY STOLE</em> they don't even make the questions they're all
        ripped from official past papers its so fucking dumb.
