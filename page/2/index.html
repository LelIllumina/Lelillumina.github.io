        <h1>I FUCKING HATE MATHS</h1>
        <h2>March 18th 2024</h2>

      <p style="animation: fadeIn 2s">
        Why do I need it pass a test for calculus level maths? like I
        <i>could</i> find it useful IRL <i>maybe</i> but honestly Im only gonna
        use it to pass this test. I need to be good at math to be in computer
        science? Sure in that case <em>ILL LEARN WHAT I NEED</em> you know
        <em>LIKE I DO WITH EVERYTHING ELSE</em>, forcing me learn shit I cant
        even with Motherfucking youtube Indian teach classes is just gonna make
        me bomb everything else Im actually good at.<sub>(not much)</sub>
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fadeIn 3s">
        I also just dont like maths teachers much, I understand you cant bump up
        marks on something like maths because it isnt something subjective as
        English or something but stil you could maybe
        <em>NOT DEDUCT MARKS FOR WRITING HALF INSTEAD OF HALVE,</em> if this
        isnt an english test dont grade me on my english, like dude that dropped
        me to 99/100 in like 2nd grade, the only grade a had a chance of aceing
        a subject and I was denied that by some butthurt teacher who hates 10
        year olds or how ever old I was.
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fadeIn 4s">
        back to AS Level maths it's funny I cant even use AI to learn it
        properly cuz AI's are appaerntly <em>FUCKING DOGSHIT</em> at maths, who
        wouldve thought that. Often time they just spew random shit that dosent
        make sense and just confuse me more, or assume I already know how to
        solve the question and Im testing it, dawg,
        <strong
          >I DUNNO HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS EXPLAIN IT BETTER PLEASE ITS YOUR
          JOB.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fadeIn 5s">
        This all isnt helped by the fact that the world decided education needs
        to be privlige of the rich, the mfs who already have everything, becuase
        I cant access some regular ass fucking questions or notes without paying
        like <a href="https://www.savemyexams.com/join/">20 bucks a month</a>.
        Wanna pirate it instead? well
        <em>FUCK YOU WE DMCAed THAT SHIT,</em> they took down fucking Past paper
        questions and answers and notes and shit <em>THAT THEY STOLE</em> they
        dont even make the questions theyre all ripped from official past papars
        its so fucking dumb.
