        Whether you've played the Fate/Stay Night visual novel and want to play
        the other games or have never played or watched a single bit of Fate,
        this guide will tell you how you can get started with any of the games
        in the franchise (well, at least the ones listed, I'll definitely miss a
        few). I'll include official, torrent, and DDL links whenever
        appropriate.

          Tsukihime, Melty Blood or Mahoyo</strong

      </p>
      <h2 id="where" style="animation: fade-in 0.8s">Where to start playing</h2>
      <p style="animation: fade-in 1s">
        Regardless of what Fate media you have already watched, read, or played,
        if you haven't read the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, that's a good
        place to start. After that, you have the “sequel,” Fate/Hollow Ataraxia.
        Both of these are visual novels, so they require amounts of reading.
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fade-in 1.2s">
        After those two, you can start playing, realistically, any other Fate
        series. Though, I would suggest playing Fate/Extra games before
        Fate/Grand Order, the fighting games Fate/Unlimited Codes and Fate/Tiger
        Colosseum can be played any time after the Fate/Stay Night Visual Novel.

      <h3 id="FSN" style="animation: fade-in 1.6s">Fate/Stay Night</h3>
      <p style="animation: fade-in 1.8s">
        The first Fate game ever released. It has several versions, such as the
        PS2, PSP, and even the Android release. It serves as the best starting
        point with its world-building and because of the fact that it's a visual
        novel.
      </p>
      <p style="animation: fade-in 2s">
        Originally released in 2004, it recently received a remaster 20 years
        after the release of the original with official translations and 16:9
        visuals. This is the current best translation, as it is official.
        However, it does not contain any H-scenes, if you want those, you'll
        have to play the older, fan-translated Fate/Stay Night Réalta Nua

        Fate/Stay Night Réalta Nua Ultimate Edition

      <p style="animation: fade-in 3s">
        This is actually the Ultimate Edition, where all the routes are together
        in one exe instead of 3 separate ones. As this is the older version the
        translation is fan-made and all the CGs are 4:3.

        A kinda-sequel to the first VN, but it's more like all three routes got
        merged, apparently, I haven't actually played it myself, so I couldn't
        tell you.

          For the full decensored NSFW CGs you will need to add a patch yourself
          to the torrented game, otherwise the game only has the SFW CGs.

      <h4 id="FE" style="animation: fade-in 4.2s">Fate/Extra</h4>
      <p style="animation: fade-in 4.4">
        The first game in the Extraverse, which has 4 games and a 5th one in the
        making, Fate Extra follows a different story, different characters,
        different universe, etc. I personally think the release order is a good
        order to play in, but I haven't really finished the games yet myself.

        for a chronological order with the anime. Fate/Extra Record is a
        upcoming remake/remaster of Fate/Extra.

        <strong
          >For Fate/Extra and Fate/Extra CCC you'll need to install
          <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/">PPSSPP</a>

          to play the game as they were PSP games. Also download the HD texture
          replacment pack.</strong

        Another kinda-sequel where certain event near the end of Fate/Extra
        happen to derail the story into that of CCC.
