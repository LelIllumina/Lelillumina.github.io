Living in Pakistan, I'm pretty much halfway around the globe, latitude-wise, from America, where most of the nekoweb demographic is.
As such when something interesting occurs, it's usually past midnight for me, and the date has fallen forward. So today, which for me is the 31st of January 2025, and the 30th of January 2025 for most of you, I would like to congratulate our dear trademarkhell on being reborn, and wish him a happy neko-birthday.

On this wonderful transformation I would like to see him give way to new ideals and letting go of his view farming, follower gathering, guestbook whoring ways. I hope he understands that making websites is about creation and not clout and numbers.

However, I would like my 2 (two) readers to go support him by following him on [trademarkhell.net](https://trademarkhell.net). His rebirth is a new beginning, and I hope he can make the most of it.

This was just a short congratulatory post, I hope you all have a wonderful day.  
Good night.
