On the 29th this month it will be 1 whole year that my site has existed on nekoweb.  
Even though for a long while in this I haven't been active, on either the site or the community I'd like to make a blog post about it. So while I've started writing it out already I'll publish it on the 29th and hope a few people would at least read it.  
I would also like to hit 40k views before then.

Update: we did
