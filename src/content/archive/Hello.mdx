I'm lel, I'm not much of a talker so, I don't know why I decided to make this page, after all to make it look good I need to yap a lot to fill up all this space, and even then nobody is going to read it except me, which is kind of annoying considering I have to cringe at myself writing all of this for nothing, but then again I'm going to send this in _every_ discord channel I have so that's probably a few more views.

I don't really know what to say, so I'll say I little about myself. This is my first website, but I've always been into tech, since I was a kid with no internet until now. Currently, I'm just a student (and procrastinating by making this webpage) in computer science actually, however I actually do not go to school and study at home, that's why I never get shit done.

Other than tech, I'm a big fan of anime, or at least I was a couple of years ago, I started watching anime back in 2018, now 6 years ago!! And that was probably the first time I consumed non kid TV media. I enjoyed it enough to watch around 200 anime in just 2 years, but I'd slowed down after that to only a few dozen anime a year (I know, very few /s). Even so I really like anime and even manga and VNs/LNs (even though I don't read books often), my favorite anime series and movies are often those with cross media story telling in their works, for example Fate with its many, many spinoffs, all with connected concepts even with their creator, type-moon/kinoku nasu's other works. There's also Toaru with _its_ spinoffs and multiple perspectives.

Anyway, it seems like I've padded up the text enough for now, I got the idea for this from [Remblanc's website](https://remblanc.nekoweb.org), I liked how clean it looked but I also kind of wanted to have my own twist. So I choose monospace fonts because I like how they look, and instead of white on black I went with the [Everforest Dark theme](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) because I feel it's a nice theme for showing a lot of text, it was made for vim after all.
