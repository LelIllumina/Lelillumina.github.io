## What is this guide for? Who is this guide for?

Whether you've played the Fate/Stay Night visual novel and want to play the other games or have never played or watched a single bit of Fate, this guide will tell you how you can get started with any of the games in the franchise (well, at least the ones listed, I'll definitely miss a few). I'll include official, torrent, and DDL links whenever appropriate.
**This guide will not tell you about other Type-Moon games such as Tsukihime, Melty Blood or Mahoyo**

## Where to start playing

Regardless of what Fate media you have already watched, read, or played, if you haven't read the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, that's a good place to start. After that, you have the “sequel,” Fate/Hollow Ataraxia. Both of these are visual novels, so they require amounts of reading.

After those two, you can start playing, realistically, any other Fate series. Though, I would suggest playing Fate/Extra games before Fate/Grand Order, the fighting games Fate/Unlimited Codes and Fate/Tiger Colosseum can be played any time after the Fate/Stay Night Visual Novel.

## Game List

### Fate/Stay Night

The first Fate game ever released. It has several versions, such as the PS2, PSP, and even the Android release. It serves as the best starting point with its world-building and because it's a visual novel.

Originally released in 2004, it recently received a remaster 20 years after the release of the original with official translations and 16:9 visuals. This is the current best translation, as it is official. However, it does not contain any H-scenes, if you want those, you'll have to play the older, fan-translated Fate/Stay Night Réalta Nua

#### Fate/Stay Night REMASTERED

You can buy the remaster officially from Steam or, more likely, pirate it

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396980/Fatestay_night_REMASTERED/) [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/view/1856596)

#### Fate/Stay Night Réalta Nua Ultimate Edition

This is actually the Ultimate Edition, where all the routes are together in one EXE instead of 3 separate ones. As this is the older version the translation is fan-made and all the CGs are 4:3.

#### Fate/Hollow Ataraxia

A kinda-sequel to the first VN, but it's more like all three routes got merged, apparently, I haven't actually played it myself, so I couldn't tell you.

**For the full decensored NSFW CGs you will need to add a patch yourself to the torrented game, otherwise the game only has the SFW CGs.**

### Fate/Extra-verse

#### Fate/Extra

The first game in the Extraverse, which has 4 games and a 5th one in the making, Fate Extra follows a different story, different characters, different universe, etc. I personally think the release order is a good order to play in, but I haven't really finished the games yet myself. You can also check out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatestaynight/comments/gusnd6/comment/fsoxnc5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for a chronological order with the anime. Fate/Extra Record is an upcoming remake/remaster of Fate/Extra.

**For Fate/Extra and Fate/Extra CCC you'll need to install [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/) to play the game as they were PSP games. Also download the HD texture replacement pack.**

#### Fate/Extra CCC

Another kinda-sequel where certain event near the end of Fate/Extra happen to derail the story into that of CCC.
**As with Fate/Extra, Fate/Extra CCC is a PSP game and requires PPSSPP. It also has its own Texture Replacement**
