I often see people trying to pirate stuff off the Internet in the worst ways possible, and it vehemently destroys my mental health, as such I hold you all accountable for causing me mental trauma and I sentence you to rehabilitation, i.e. this guide to (objectively) better pirating. This is also how I pirate content because I'm the best. I'll also add a tl;dr section to each part if you don't want to read all the yapping.

## Anime/Shows/Movie

Let's start off with one of the most commonly pirated category, Digital video.  
While I don't watch anime as much as I used to, and I haven't really watched many shows and movies at all, I do want to experience the most convenient and high quality product there is. While I can't do much about the hardware I have, getting the best video out there is not that hard, especially for anime.

### Stremio

[Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) is a Media server/Media Center/Content Aggregator/Whatever that unlike other similar products (Plex, kodi, jellyfin, etc.) has most of the processing done server-side, while this may seem like a con or disadvantage to a lot, it makes piracy way easier, especially on weaker hardware and slower internet. However, the real star is its add-on library, there are many useful plugins but with just 1 plugin you can get basically any show you want to instantly start streaming and at THE best quality you are likely to find. This is the [Torrentio](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) add-on.

### Torrentio

Most high quality videos aren't on a central server with http streams, that poses quite a lot of issues related to bandwidth and reliability as well as longevity and redistribution/archiving. As such a more common platform are torrents which have p2p.  
Torrentio aggregates torrent aggregating sites and provides magnet links in the stremio client itself, making it pretty easy to load up stremio, find a show you want to watch, click on any link Torrentio provided, and you have your stream running now, often times at faster download speeds than http piracy sites.

### Video Quality

When using Torrentio you'll probably get many different torrent links and knowing which one is the best is useful. At first glance just picking the torrent with the biggest file size and most seeders would be the best choice as that usually indicates a higher bitrate, aka, better quality. But if you want more reassurance, at least for Anime, you can search for what you're watching on these two sites:

- [Sneedex](https://sneedex.moe/)
- [Seadex/releases.moe](https://releases.moe/)

FYI you can also make a better educated guess by looking at the torrent name, usually "BDrip" and "FLAC" are a good sign.

### Pro/Cons

|                                                       Pros                                                        |                                                             Cons                                                              |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Faster than regular HTTPS streams, especially if you live in an area away from where servers are usually located. |                                You might need to use a VPN depending on your country and ISP.                                 |
|                     Higher Quality Video and Audio than compressed content from piracy sites.                     | If an add-on's server goes down, unless you self-host it, you have to wait for it to be back up; server uptime (rare though). |
|                                    Stremio syncs your library between devices                                     |                                          Server-side handling + requires an account.                                          |

### Tracking

If you like to have your watched shows tracked, stremio has built-in Trakt support, and you can get this [Anilist Add-on](https://github.com/Jenrykster/animeo) for anilist support.

If you want to stick with websites you have [MALSync](https://malsync.moe/) and for downloaded videos you can use [Taiga](https://taiga.moe/) (Windows only).

### TL;DR

Get [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) and [Torrentio](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) then look at either [Sneedex](https://sneedex.moe/) or [Seadex/releases.moe](https://releases.moe/).
Get [Anilist Add-on](https://github.com/Jenrykster/animeo) for tracking.

### Notes

Stremio is cross-platform so you can have it on your phone, TV, PC, even just a browser but iOS is a bit broken.
