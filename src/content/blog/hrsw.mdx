It is the year 2034, A sole man lies on a hospital bed peering outside the window into the university's yard, a _Lotus_ floating in its pond. This man, Susumu Hirasawa, at his ripe age of 80 years old, rests his head in his town's university's medical facility. It's the nearest place that provides Kampo for his medical treatment.

He ponders about his life, still gazing out his ward's window, observing the botanical garden, which in the near distance, which, as if maintained by the _Gardener King_ sat in the wind, immaculate. His rich history slowly coming back to him as he thinks about his choices throughout his life.
About his start with Mandrakeâ€”then his shift to P-Model and then when he worked alone. Throughout his various styles. Thinking about his brother and his help. His numerous trips to Thailand. His Interactive lives shows. His own musical instruments which he had invented. His many beliefs and what had formed them. About how he was probably the only person to play heat on an electric guitar at a live event while wearing suspenders and pants.  
These many thoughts back in time steadily pass through his mind as he sits up to grab his "Miracle Mineral Supplement" which he sneaked in to his room and kept in _The Blind Spot in a Corridor_.  
He squeezes out a dribble from the bottle and drinks it, unbeknownst to him, slowly deteriorating his body and brain, like _A Drop Filled With Memories_ of his, being washed away.

He steadies himself upright as he remembers of the Anime he's worked on, the _Solar Rays_ hitting his face through the window, he ponders about the stories of the films with he did with Satoshi Kon and of Berserk. His mind wanders to his views on "Moe" and modern anime, as he drinks on his MMS he thinks of the souless characters of the new generation. About how they _Parade_ that mid-tier shit while they're nothing more than cash grabs as marketable products with no deeper value or lore. How the industry prefers quick slop to stories with characters people can relate to and those that talk about the real world. When suddenly, he starts to feel a little dizzy.

The MMS, not really great for his health, starts to have some side effects. His stomach starts churning, his forehead moistening with sweat, his color getting paler, his breath quickening, feeling like _Solid Air_ and his vision harder to maintain. Just as he tries to settle, hitting the bed with a _Hard Landing_, there he spots _The Visitor_ in his room, or so he thought, it really was just the _Nurse_ who was bringing him coffee. Seeing him in distress she goes over to help the patient. Her footsteps _Echoes_ on and on in Hirasawa's ears.  
She grabs him, while scolding him for his mischievous deeds and lays him on his bed, it isn't late that Mr. Hirasawa falls asleep.

Past the _Ghost Bridge_ he says hi to _Bridge Builder_. Walking on with the _Siam Lights_ he spots an figure up ahead, an _Avatar Alone_. He walks over to see his friend, Satoshi Kon. He calls out to him and in response he just stands in front of him. A few seconds later, he smiles. "Let it got Hirasawa, moe isn't so bad you know?", with those words, his old friend starts to fade, the world around him crumbling, His dream, His _Soul Home_ falling apart, until he wakes up.  
He stares at his familiar ceiling and beings again to ponder.

Don't worry, After that he lived _Another Day_. In fact, many more days.
