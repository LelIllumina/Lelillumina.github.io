Dear young prince and princess of the Haiweb Empire,

I, sir Lelcelot, write to you today on the 2nd of March, a Sunday, to inform you of my secession from your Magnificent realm.  
I have taken upon this decision as sought the personal growth I could not achieve while serving the Kingdom. Furthermore, I do believe this is not the crime of deserting the empire or abandonment of post as I shall return eventually, and I must have faith that you will allow me to once again enter the beautiful Empire when the time should come.

In the meantime, I trust that the other knights can make up for my lapse of standing and are sufficient in their duty to replace me.

I hope this letter found you well, and please do let go of my pigeon as he is quite dear to me.  
I wish the both of you a long and happy life together.

With love and regards,  
Your beloved Knight Lelcelot Cummings.
