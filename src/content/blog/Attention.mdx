I often find myself doing stuff just because it seems to get a nice reaction out of people, regardless of whether I actually believe in what's behind the meaning of the things I say or do.  
What I mean is that, even when I'm talking with friends, I say stuff that's just said for the sake of saying something, as a way to contribute to a conversation, even if it's otherwise a practically worthless statement. If I do have something to say, I'll even interject when someone else is talking about a topic and I just so happen to have a similar experience to share. Possibly even pivoting the conversation towards me, though usually that's not my intention. To me, the latter at least seems fine for most cases, but it still feels as though in the end, all I say or do is to get some sort of positive reaction or feedback out of people.

There's also the other part of me who kind of also just does not care. I used to get pretty heated on random little things, that were just rage bait or annoying, but now most things just don't seem to matter even if they're serious. Maybe I just take relationships with people superficially now, but I feel like I could be ignored and shoved away, and I'll just get over it soon enough. Obviously that's what I feel like would happen; perhaps in reality I really would be hurt a bit, but I don't know. Overall is this just how people talk, or am I the odd one out?

Little things and details like these are not as easily noticeable online as they are in person, when you can see and hear the people you're talking to and the people talking to each other, too. However, basically all of my conversations with people, especially people I'm more open with and people who are around my age and vibe, have been online. I never learned to really notice any minute details or signs, or even learn how a normal conversation really is, to be honest. So in the end, I don't know. So really, what kind of person am I?
