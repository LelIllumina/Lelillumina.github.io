Today I would like to break off my hiatus and address my situation with the [Nekoweb Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hvfHKyVS6b).

As some of you might know I have now been banned from the Nekoweb discord server for an extended amount of time at this point, and as such I have had a long time to think about my actions and how they affected the community. In this short but interminable period, I have felt great sorrow and regret for my actions and would like to make that known.

A few of you may know that I was banned alongside our friend [trademarkhell](https://trademarkhell.net) and after a few days he has completely vanished from all previous servers and contact locations leaving behind [this](https://trademarkhell.net/blog/contrarianism/) message. This too has affected me greatly. No further comments.

I had joined the Nekoweb server way back in April, back then it wasn't even close to 1000 members, it had people a lot of you readers won't even recognize. I was the first member to make custom CSS themes for the main page, and as such pioneered the vision for custom themes on the old layout, which is now just a memory.

Nekoweb was the first ever free web host I had heard of, I never knew of neocities before Nekoweb and neither did I know of Vercel and Netlify. I made my first ever proper website on Nekoweb and grew its different roots from here. Stylizing my page, making projects like NekoFM, occasionally writing blogs and maybe even making memeish one-off pages, but most notably, the thing I enjoyed the most was the Nekoweb Server. No amount of working on VS Code or messing with build tools could bring me the joy I felt conversing in the discord. The discord was a place where I could share my webdev knowledge and just hang out with other Nekos. It was truly a wonderful way to express myself.

However, after the incident... I rather not get into the details, but I would like to say that I am truly sorry for my actions. Another oversight on my behalf would be unacceptable but this? I deserve a 2nd chance for this! Failure to provide a human being like me another chance is like cutting off a limb from a living being. I am not asking for a second chance to be a moderator in the server. Nor am I asking for compensation for my time-out. All I want is to go back and for us to forget all this trauma.

Being shunned away from the community I love, and I know the community that loves me back, has been a real struggle. I once again humbly apologize, I pledge my heart to you all, and I hope that you will give me another chance to be a part of this. I hope you will answer my prayers and allow me back into the place where I was meant to be, back with everyone else who I have longed for in this time alone.

I thank you for your time and patience and once again plead for your forgiveness. RIP tm.
