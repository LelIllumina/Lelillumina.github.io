It has become apparent to me that I am being unfairly, and singularly targeted, in a discriminatory act against me as a Neko. Certain groups in the Neko Kingdom have taken it upon themselves to—I would go as far as to say—defame me, holding my acts of humor and exercise of free speech accountable for it.

## Preface

After much consideration (this was an impulsive thought), I have decided to address these allegations and call out for justice and protection of me and my peers.  
Firstly, I would like to sever all relations I have had in the past to protect those people from any crossfire between me and my accusers. It would hurt me more than anything to have my fellow _real_ Nekos be caught up in my ordeal. I do not want them to feel associated if it invites targeted attacks.

## The allegations

Next, I would like to refute the allegations that I have made humorous and/or provocative statements of a particularly “vile” nature, including (but possibly not limited to) incestuous, sexual, illegal and unsavory topics. However, I had done nothing of the sorts.  
You see, I am a man fond of wordplay, I enjoy sharing portmanteaus and puns related to the speech I often use. A simple swapping of letters should not warrant a breakdown or order in a society of otherwise an intellectual and creative field, i.e., web development and design.

## To conclude

All I ask is that you reflect on what has happened, as I have, and understand how little it means. I'll work towards to not illicit unwanted discomfort. While my peers should learn to be more tolerate. If you haven't concluded that this short Epistle was anything but satire, I shall clear any doubt now, as this is very much just a facetious jab. I mean no ill-will, nor am I offended.  
I agree to have gotten carried away, although not enough to warrant any social expatriation.

Your Beloved,  
Lel Illumina.
